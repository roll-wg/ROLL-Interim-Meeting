## draft-hushe-roll-dodag-metric (Li Zhao)
[14:35]
New DODAG metric.
DODAG size is proposed as a new metric, to help nodes decide which DODAG to join.
Li Zhao Presents the draft on behalf of authors
Explains the value of DODAG si
Dominique: two bytes for size is enough?
Pascal: size in exponential units.
Rahul: what about rank? could it be used to discourage node from joining a DODAG of which the root has a full routing table? 
Li: WiSun has...different weight
Pascal: can DODAG size be conveyed by Enrollment Priority? can we merge this work into that darft? (to save admin work later on)
Rahul: Priority can be changed (increased) while passed down the DODAG, this one cannot. Not quite the same.
Aris: had a draft on balancing traffic at each node within the DODAG, by announcing number of children: This is different.
Pascal: this one is about Root routing table size. If nodes are identical and have periodic traffic, also relates to network load. Its the case for WiSun, with electrical meters.
MCR: 6TiSCH did similar stuff in EBs (outside of encrypted messages). In WiSun, do you assume a node can hear advertisments from both DODAGs?
LiZhao: first PAN advertisement is not encrypted.
MCR: look at roll-enrolment-priority, it's not a metric but could be useful. I don't think what you want is a metric in a DMC, because does not need to be evaluated at each hop down the DODAG.
Pascal: merge this into enrollment-priority, and some info on overall load as well.
Pascal: seems we still need to decide if we need this info, but in any case it should be merged into another document.
Georgios agrees.
Ines: please bring the discussion on the Mailing List.


## DAO projection, status and options (Pascal)
[15:03]
Pascal reworked draft a lot.
Track is now a DAODAG inside a DAODAG.
Node at ingress of track does encapsulation, similar to Root doing encapsulation as an ingress point into the DODAG.
6man was clear that SRH can only be inserted by the source of the packet (for error reporting).
MCR: do you mean not 6550 is used recursively?
Pascal: exactly
Pascal: now UseOfRPLInfo applies just the same way.
-16 has several examples. You can find them in the ML as well.
Can see the VIA as a multihop TIO.
MCR: originally, adding SM to non-storing mode network
Pscal: now, we have both.
6LoRH compression of SRH, usually shared 6LoRH header.
How does Root know the topology? non-storing mode and sibling info option.
Psacl: which siblings to advertise (especially if many)? IPR on that, can share.

Profile 1
SM segments within source routed main DODAG. We shorten the SRH by using the segments.

Profile 2
same as profile 1, but SR-VIO to install tracks. 
Installed by the ingress. Sgnalling is simpler.

Profiles 3+ are across the DODAG, need sibling info

Profile 3
satefull VIO, similar to Profile 1.
